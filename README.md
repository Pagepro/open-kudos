# Open Kudos

Open Kudos is an Open Source **Employee Recognition Bot** built *for digital teams.*

So if simple "thanks" is not enough, give Kudos on Slack! 

Kudos are simply points you can give to your workmates for work done, help or just for simply being kind and smiling a lot. 

Kudos can be later exchanged for prizes, which makes it a better way to say "thanks" at work, as well as a great Employee Recognition Tool. 
 
It can make a huge impact on productivity, by building a clear rewarding and motivational system.

Open Kudos is a perfect **tool for digital teams** to: 
- Reward
- Appreciate 
- Motivate
- Build company culture
- Or simply add a bit of fun at work! 

Take it and **share some feedback with us.**
