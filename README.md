Open Kudos uses a number of open source projects to work properly in future we will be adding more feauters based on other technologies:

* [node.js] - evented I/O for the backend
* [Express] - fast node.js network app framework 
* [typescript] - typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript
